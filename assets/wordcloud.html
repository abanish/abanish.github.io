<p>Data are generally massive, and getting information out of them at a glance is not possible. Therefore,
    people usually tend to use graphs, charts to display them in the business world.
    In data science, when the information is text-based,  one of the best ways to get
    something out of them is Word Clouds.
    Word Clouds are sweet visualization method that displays how frequently words
    appear in a given dataset by making the size of each word proportional to the number
    of times the word occurs in the dataset. Typically, Word Clouds are used to depict
    keywords in the text.  The words are displayed in a cluster type image.
    As seen below:</p>

<br>
In python, we can easily use a few libraries to create Word Clouds.
Libraries that are required are:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>wordcloud</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>numpy</li>
</ul>

<p>
These libraries can be easily installed using pip.
In the code below, a CSV file is used, which is a standard format
used for data storage in files. Any other filetype can be used easily.

<pre  class="prettyprint"><code>
import collections<br>
import numpy as np<br>
import pandas as pd<br>
import matplotlib.cm as cm<br>
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
from matplotlib import rcParams<br>
from wordcloud import WordCloud<br>
<br>
// dataset.csv is the file containing text<br>
dataset = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv', encoding='latin-1')<br>
<br>
// "Content" is the column which has the text to be analysed<br>
all_text = ' '.join(dataset['Content'].str.lower())<br>
<br>
wordcloud = WordCloud(background_color="white", max_words=1000).generate(all_text)<br>
<br>
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 10, 20<br>
plt.imshow(wordcloud)<br>
plt.axis("off")<br>
plt.show()<br>
</code>

<p>Removing stopwords from the body of text gives much better visualization as it
    eliminates unnecessary words and focusses on only relevant words. Stop words are a
    set of commonly used words in any language. For example, in English, “the”, “is” and
    “and”, would easily qualify as stop words.
    There is a straightforward step to remove stop words for text mining.
    All stop words can be collected in a text file. Let us say the filename
    is stopwords.txt.</p>

<pre  class="prettyprint"><code>
<br>
with open('../data/stopwords.txt', "r") as word_list:<br>
    stopwords = word_list.read().split('\n')<br>
</code>
</pre>

<p>Then add the stopword parameter to the wordcloud api call.</p>

<br>
<pre  class="prettyprint"><code>
<br>
wordcloud = WordCloud(stopwords=stopwords, background_color="white", max_words=1000).generate(all_text)<br>
</code>
</pre>

<p>One last thing, don't name the python file as wordcloud.py, it will not work. Name it anything else. :)</p>
